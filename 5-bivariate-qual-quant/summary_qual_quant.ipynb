    "The `stats.ttest_ind` function from the `scipy` library is used to perform an independent two-sample t-test. This test compares the means of two independent samples to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between them. Here's a detailed explanation of how and when this function is used, along with the meaning of each parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use `stats.ttest_ind`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comparing Two Groups**: Use this test when you have two separate groups and you want to compare their means.\n",
    "- **Independent Samples**: The samples should be independent, meaning the observations in one group do not influence the observations in the other group.\n",
    "- **Normally Distributed Data**: Ideally, the data in each group should be approximately normally distributed.\n",
    "- **Equal or Unequal Variances**: The function allows you to specify whether you assume equal variances between the two groups or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use `stats.ttest_ind`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function Signature\n",
    "```python\n",
    "scipy.stats.ttest_ind(a, b, alternative='two-sided', equal_var=True, nan_policy='propagate')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **a, b**: The two independent sample arrays you want to compare.\n",
    "- **alternative**: Specifies the alternative hypothesis:\n",
    "  - `'two-sided'` (default): Tests if the means of the two samples are different.\n",
    "  - `'less'`: Tests if the mean of the first sample is less than the mean of the second sample.\n",
    "  - `'greater'`: Tests if the mean of the first sample is greater than the mean of the second sample.\n",
    "- **equal_var**: Specifies whether to assume equal variances between the two groups. If `False`, Welch’s t-test, which does not assume equal variances, is used.\n",
    "- **nan_policy**: Defines how to handle NaNs in the input. Options are `'propagate'`, `'raise'`, or `'omit'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage\n",
    "Suppose you have two groups: a control group and a treatment group, and you want to test if the treatment group has a significantly lower mean compared to the control group. Here's how you would do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "from scipy import stats\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example data\n",
    "control = np.array([5.1, 5.8, 6.5, 7.2, 7.5, 8.0])\n",
    "treatment = np.array([4.1, 4.5, 4.8, 5.0, 5.3, 5.8])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform the t-test\n",
    "result = stats.ttest_ind(a=control, b=treatment, alternative='less', equal_var=False)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the results\n",
    "print(\"Statistic:\", result.statistic)\n",
    "print(\"P-value:\", result.pvalue)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Statistic**: The t-statistic value. It measures the size of the difference relative to the variation in the sample data.\n",
    "- **P-value**: The p-value tells you the probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis is true. A low p-value (typically < 0.05) indicates that you can reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: The means of the control and treatment groups are equal.\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: The mean of the control group is greater than the mean of the treatment group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we specified `alternative='less'`, we are testing if the mean of the control group is greater than the mean of the treatment group.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the p-value is less than your chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), you can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the treatment group has a significantly lower mean than the control group.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Specific Parameters\n",
    "- **`alternative='less'` or `'greater'`**: Use these when you have a directional hypothesis (i.e., you expect one mean to be less than or greater than the other).\n",
    "- **`equal_var=False`**: Use Welch’s t-test when you suspect that the variances of the two groups are not equal. This is more robust in the presence of unequal variances and different sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding these parameters and their applications, you can effectively use `stats.ttest_ind` to analyze differences between two independent groups in your data."

    "### When to Use `stats.ttest_rel`\n",
    "\n",
