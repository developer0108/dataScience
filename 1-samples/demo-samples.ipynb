[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a free online iPython development environment, but it does require a Google account in order to use it. You can create a local clone of the Github repo with the lab assignments and upload the Notebook files you want to work with to Colab.\n",

Usually, that's not a problem, but sometimes you will run into errors, e.g. because some parameter in our Python code didn't exist yet in that version. The solution is to add a new code block at the beginning of your Notebook file with content:"
